"Only" received generally positive reviews from critics. Carolyn Menyes from [[Music Times]] gave the song a positive review, saying "With a cool sense of confidence and rhymes that boast of her own sexual and rapping prowess, Minaj is taking the reins, leading into the equally vulgar and explosive rap verses from Drake and Wayne".<ref>{{cite web|title=REVIEW: Nicki Minaj, Drake, Lil Wayne & Chris Brown Show Confident Presence on "Only" Ahead of 'The Pink Print' Release Date [LISTEN]|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/13687/20141028/review-nicki-minaj-drake-lil-wayne-chris-brown-only-listen.htm|publisher=''Music Times''|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> Brennan Carley from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' said ""Only" is Nicki at her dirtiest and smartest, rapping with metaphors that'd fly over other rappers' heads while keeping the glint of a knowing wink always in her eye."<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicki Minaj Spits Fire on YMCMB Posse Cut, 'Only'|url=http://www.spin.com/articles/nicki-minaj-chris-brown-drake-lil-wayne-only/|publisher=''Spin''|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> Miles Raymer from ''Entertainment Weekly'' praised Minaj's rap and called it the best part of the song.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicki Minaj and some other, less important guys release 'Only'|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2014/10/28/nicki-minaj-drake-lil-wayne-chris-brown-only/|publisher=''Entertainment Weekly''|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> Chris Coplan from Consequence of Sound said although it wasn't the strongest effort from them three, the song was "a great display of how their separate and distinct personalities can still play off one another nicely".<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicki Minaj teams with Drake and Lil Wayne for "Only" — listen|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/10/nicki-minaj-teams-with-drake-and-lil-wayne-for-only-listen/|publisher=''Consequence of Sound''|accessdate= 28 October 2014}}</ref> Drew Millard from Noisey praised Lil Wayne's verse and said "Minaj continues to rap laps around the competition and there's no indication that that's going to change any time soon".<ref>{{cite web|title=LISTEN TO NICKI MINAJ'S "ONLY," FEATURING DRAKE, LIL WAYNE, AND CHRIS BROWN|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/listen-to-nicki-minajs-only-featuring-drake-lil-wayne-and-chris-brown|publisher=''Noisey''|accessdate= 28 October 2014}}</ref>

Matthew Trammell of The Fader gave the song a negative review, saying Minaj delivers "sleepy lines" and comes off "a bit desperate".<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicki Minaj Releases New Single Feat.

==Controversy==
Minaj released a lyric music video for the song in early November 2014, premiering close to the 25th anniversary of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], with visualisations inspired by the [[Nazi]] Regime and the work of [[Leni Riefenstahl]].<ref name=billboardvideo>{{cite web|last1=Stutz|first1=Colin|title=Watch Nicki Minaj's Totalitarian 'Only' Lyric Video With Drake, Lil Wayne, Chris Brown|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6312124/nicki-minajs-only-lyric-video-drake-lil-wayne-chris-brown|website=Billboard|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref> There was immediate backlash from fans, calling the video anti-semitic and insensitive. Many fans expressed their outrage on social media websites like [[Twitter]] and [[Tumblr]].<ref name=huffpovideo>{{cite web|last1=Zupkus|first1=Lauren|title=People Aren't Happy With The Nazi Imagery In Nicki Minaj's 'Only' Lyric Video|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/09/nicki-minaj-only-lyric-video-nazi_n_6129892.html?utm_hp_ref=entertainment&ir=Entertainment|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=ontd>{{cite web|title=Nicki Minaj Channels Hitler & Nazi Imagery in Lyric Video for "Only"|url=http://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/92233339.html|website=Oh No They Didn't|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=smhnicki>{{cite web|last1=Zuel|first1=Bernard|title=Nicki Minaj accused of toying with Nazi imagery in Only clip|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/nicki-minaj-accused-of-toying-with-nazi-imagery-in-only-clip-20141110-11jo70.html#ixzz3IeLyJi47|website=The Sunday Morning Herald|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

[[Buzzfeed]] detailed the video, created by Jeff Osborne: "''Nicki is depicted as a powerful military leader in charge of an army that look suspiciously like a bunch SS officers. Red flags that feature a distorted, swastika-looking version of her initials are featured throughout the video. There’s a Nuremberg-esque parking lot for her tanks. And her soldiers are shown wearing Nazi-esque armbands.''"<ref name=buzzfeedvideo>{{cite web|last1=Dunlap|first1=Kelly|title=Nicki Minaj Accused Of Using Nazi Imagery In New Video|url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/kelleydunlap/nicki-minaj-only-video-nazi-imagery|website=Buzzfeed|publisher=Buzzfeed|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref> Osborne was inspired by conspiracy theorist [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]] in his creation of the video.<ref>http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/11/nicki-minaj-nazi-video-was-inspired-by-hero-alex-jones-director-reveals/</ref> [[Gawker]] pointed out that although Nicki Minaj is not the first entertainer to derive inspiration from Nazi imagery, "generally artists have refrained from using comparisons to Hitler's regime as a compliment."<ref name=gawkervideo>{{cite web|last1=Hongo|first1=Hudson|title=Critics Blast Nicki Minaj for Nazi-Inspired Music Video|url=http://gawker.com/critics-blast-nicki-minaj-for-nazi-inspired-music-video-1656595337|website=Gawker|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> Guest-rapper Drake, who is Jewish, was also criticized for his involvement in the video.<ref name=jpostvideo>{{cite web|title=Nicki Minaj comes under fire for alleged use of Nazi imagery in new music video|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Niki-Minaj-comes-under-fire-for-alleged-use-of-Nazi-imagery-in-new-music-video-381255|website=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

Minaj later issued a statement on the video via her Twitter account, "I didn't come up with the concept, but I'm very sorry and take full responsibility if it has offended anyone. I'd never condone Nazism in my art," also citing that her producer is Jewish.<ref name=nicktwitterresponse1>{{cite web|last1=Maraj|first1=Onika|title=NICKI MINAJ on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/532153631588376576|website=Twitter|accessdate=11 November 2014}}</ref> The artist behind the video, Jeff Osborne, refused to apologize for the video, confirming that the imagery used was indeed inspired by Nazism: "...if my work is misinterpreted because it’s not a sappy tearjerker, sorry I’m not sorry." Neither Minaj nor Osborne responded to criticism that the video was released on the anniversary of the [[Kristallnacht]].<ref name=pitchforkref>{{cite web|last1=Camp|first1=Zoe|title=Nicki Minaj Responds to Accusations of Nazi Imagery|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/57406-nicki-minaj-responds-to-accusations-of-nazi-imagery-in-only-lyric-video/|website=Pitchbook|accessdate=11 November 2014}}</ref> Minaj tweeted that Osborne was influenced by the ''[[Metalocalypse]]'' [[Dethklok]] music video for "The Gears" as well as ''[[Sin City]]'' when creating the music video. Brandon Small, creator of ''Metalocalypse'' responded to the comparison, stating that "They seem to be confused about art" before deconstruction the meaning behind both videos. He also added that he does not believe Minaj had poor intentions.<ref>[https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/532151721921748992 @NickiMinaj]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalinsider.net/video/metalocalypse-creator-brendon-small-comments-on-nicki-minaj-video |title=Metalocalypse creator Brendon Small on Nicki Minaj video: ‘They seem to be confused about art’ |publisher=Metal Insider |date=November 12, 2014 |accessdate=November 12, 2014 |author=Bram Teitelman }}</ref>

==Music video==
The accompanying music video for "Only", which was directed by [[Hannah Lux Davis]], premiered on December 12, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2014/12/12/video-nicki-minaj-f-drake-lil-wayne-chris-brown-only/|title=VIDEO: NICKI MINAJ F/ DRAKE, LIL WAYNE, & CHRIS BROWN – ‘ONLY’|date=December 12, 2014|accessdate=December 14, 2014|publisher=''Rap-Up''}}</ref> The video opens with an injured man lying on the floor in what appears to be a chamber. He is then taken to room were many other tortured men are tied up in a room. The video then cuts to Minaj who is wearing black-feathered lingerie. She raps wearing a sheer getup and sky-high platform heels. Minaj and Drake standing side by side while Nicki dons what looks like a black lace wedding veil. Minaj, Wayne, and Drake stand in a run-down dungeon as Minaj continues to rap.

The '''National Socialist German Workers' Party''' ({{audio-de|Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei|De-Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei.ogg}}, abbreviated '''NSDAP'''), commonly referred to in English as the '''Nazi Party''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɑː|t|s|i}}), was a [[political party]] in Germany active between 1920 and 1945 that practised [[Nazism]]. Its predecessor, the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. 
{{Nazism sidebar |expanded=Organizations}}
The party emerged from the [[German nationalism|German nationalist]], [[Racism|racist]] and [[Populism|populist]] ''[[Freikorps]]'' paramilitary culture, which fought against the [[communist]] uprisings in post-[[World War I]] Germany.<ref name="stormtroopers"/> Advocacy of a form of [[socialism]] by right-wing figures and movements in [[Germany]] became common during and after World War I, influencing Nazism.<ref name="university"/> [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]] of the [[Conservative Revolutionary movement]] [[Neologism|coined]] the term "[[Third Reich]]",<ref name="macmillan"/> and advocated an ideology combining the nationalism of the right and the socialism of the left.<ref name="millennial"/> Prominent Conservative Revolutionary member [[Oswald Spengler]]'s conception of a "[[Preussentum und Sozialismus|Prussian Socialism]]" influenced the Nazis.<ref name="university1"/> The party was created as a means to draw workers away from communism and into ''völkisch'' nationalism.<ref name="stormtroopers2"/> Initially, Nazi political strategy focused on [[Big business|anti-big business]], [[Bourgeoisie|anti-bourgeois]], and [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] rhetoric, although such aspects were later downplayed in order to gain the support of industrial entities, and in 1930s the party's focus shifted to antisemitic and anti-Marxist themes.<ref name="mcdonough"/>

Racism was central to Nazism. The Nazis sought to improve the stock of the Germanic people through racial purity and [[eugenics]], broad social welfare programs, and a disregard for the value of individual life, which could be sacrificed for the good of the Nazi state and the "[[Aryan race|Aryan]] [[master race]]". To maintain the supposed purity and strength of the Aryan Race, the Nazis sought to [[Genocide|exterminate]] [[Jews]], [[Romani people|Romani]], and the [[Physical disability|physically]] and [[Developmental disability|mentally handicapped]]. They imposed exclusionary segregation on [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust|homosexuals]], Africans, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and political opponents.<ref name="massachusetts"/> The persecution reached its climax when the party-controlled German state organized the systematic murder of approximately six million Jews and five million people from the other targeted groups, in what has become known as [[the Holocaust]]. Today, the racial theories on which Nazi ideology and the Aryan Race were based are universally recognized as pseudoscientific.<ref>Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy, "Racial Theories", edited by William F. Williams, pp. 293-294</ref>

The party's leader since 1921, [[Adolf Hitler]], was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]] by President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] in 1933. Hitler rapidly established a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime<ref name="totalitarianism"/><ref name="totalitarianism3"/><ref name="totalitarianism4"/><ref name="totalitarianism5"/> known as the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. Following the defeat of the Third Reich at the conclusion of [[World War II]] in Europe, the party was "completely and finally abolished and declared to be illegal" by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] occupying powers.

==Etymology==
The term "Nazi", commonly used in English, derives from the first two syllables of ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' (NSDAP).<ref name="NSspeak"/> It parallels the German term ''Sozi'' (pronounced /zoːtsi/), an abbreviation of ''Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands'' ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]).<ref name="SZspeak"/><ref name="Mautner"/> Members of the party referred to themselves as ''Nationalsozialisten'' (National Socialists), rarely as Nazis. The term ''Parteigenossen'' (party member) was commonly used among Nazis, with the feminine form ''Parteigenossinnen'' added when it was appropriate.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hitler|first=Adolf|title=Die Reden des Führers am Parteitag der Ehre, 1936|date=1936|publisher=Zentralverlag der NSDAP|location=Munich|page=10|url=https://archive.org/details/DieRedendesFuehrersamParteitagderEhre1936|language=German|quote="Parteigenossen! Parteigenossinnen! Nationalsozialisten!}}</ref>

The term was in use before the rise of the party as a colloquial and derogatory word for a backwards [[peasant]], characterising an awkward and clumsy person. It derived from ''Ignaz'', being a shortened version of [[Ignatius]],<ref name=Copenhagen>{{cite book|editor1-last=Gottlieb|editor1-first=Henrik|editor2-last=Morgensen|editor2-first=Jens Erik|title=Dictionary Visions, Research and Practice: Selected Papers from the 12th International Symposium on Lexicography, Copenhagen, 2004 |date=2007|publisher=J.

In 1933, when [[Adolf Hitler]] assumed power of the German government, usage of the designation "Nazi" diminished in Germany, although Austrian anti-Nazis continued to use the term as an insult.<ref name="Mautner"/> The use of "[[Nazi Germany]]," "Nazi regime," and so on was popularised by anti-Nazis and German exiles abroad. From them, the term spread into other languages and eventually was brought back to Germany after the Second World War.<ref name=Sourcebook />

==History==

===Origins and early existence: 1918–1923===

The party grew out of smaller political groups with a nationalist orientation that formed in the last years of [[World War&nbsp;I]]. In 1918, a league called the ''Freien Arbeiterausschuss für einen guten Frieden'' (Free Workers' Committee for a good Peace){{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} was created in [[Bremen]], Germany. On 7 March 1918, [[Anton Drexler]], an avid German nationalist, formed a branch of this league in [[Munich]] called the "Committee of Independent Workmen".<ref name="RisenFalloftTRp.33"/> Drexler was a local locksmith in Munich who had been a member of the militarist [[Fatherland Party (Germany)|Fatherland Party]]<ref name="RisenFalloftTRp.34"/> during [[World War I]], and was bitterly opposed to the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice]] of November 1918 and the revolutionary upheavals that followed. Drexler followed the typical views of militant nationalists of the day, such as opposing the [[Treaty of Versailles]], having [[antisemitism|antisemitic]], anti-monarchist and anti-Marxist views, as well as believing in the superiority of Germans whom nationalists claimed to be part of the [[Aryan race|Aryan]] "[[master race]]" (''Herrenvolk''), but he also accused international capitalism of being a Jewish-dominated movement and denounced capitalists for war profiteering in World War I.<ref name="Spector, pp. 137"/> Drexler saw the situation of political violence and instability in Germany as the result of the new [[Weimar Republic]] being out-of-touch with the masses, especially the lower classes.<ref name="Spector, pp. 137"/> Drexler emphasized the need for a synthesis of ''völkisch'' nationalism with a form of [[socialist|economic socialism]], in order to create a popular nationalist-oriented workers' movement that could challenge the rise of Communism and [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist politics]].<ref name="university6"/> These were all well-known themes popular with various [[Weimar paramilitary groups]] such as the [[Freikorps]]. 
<!--[[File:NSDAP-Logo.svg|thumb|left|165px|Nazi Party emblem]]-->
Though very small, Drexler's movement did receive attention and support from some influential figures. Drexler's supporter [[Dietrich Eckhart]] brought military figure Count [[Felix Graf von Bothmer]], a prominent supporter of the concept of "national socialism", to address the movement.<ref name="TheodoreFred"/> Later in 1918, [[Karl Harrer]] (a journalist and member of the [[Thule Society]]), along with Drexler and several others formed the ''Politischer Arbeiterzirkel'' (Political Workers' Circle).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} The members met periodically for discussions with themes of nationalism and racism directed against the Jews.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} In December 1918, Drexler decided a new political party should be formed based on the political principles which he endorsed by combining his Committee of Independent Workmen with the Political Workers' Circle.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}}<ref name="university7"/>

On 5 January 1919, Drexler created a new political party and proposed it be named the "German Socialist Worker's Party", but Harrer objected to the term "socialist"; the issue was settled by removing the term and the party was named the [[German Workers' Party]] (''Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'', DAP).<ref name="carlsten"/> To ease concerns among potential middle-class supporters, Drexler made clear that unlike Marxists, the party supported the middle-class, and that the party's socialist policy was meant to give [[social welfare provision|social welfare]] to German citizens deemed part of the Aryan race.<ref name="Spector, pp. 137"/> They became one of many [[völkisch movement|''völkisch'' movements]] that existed in Germany at the time. Like other ''völkisch'' groups, the DAP advocated the belief that through [[profit-sharing]] instead of [[socialization (economics)|socialisation]] Germany should become a unified "[[national community]]" (''Volksgemeinschaft'') rather than a society divided along class and party lines.<ref name="Face of the 3rd Reich"/> This ideology was explicitly antisemitic. As early as 1920, the party was raising money by selling a tobacco called ''Anti-Semit''.<ref name="weidenfeld"/>
[[File:Nsdap01.jpg|thumb|upright|The party card, 1939]]
From the outset, the DAP was opposed to non-nationalist political movements, especially on the left, including the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) and the newly formed [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD). Members of the DAP saw themselves as fighting against "[[Bolshevik|Bolshevism]]" and anyone considered a part of or aiding so-called "[[Antisemitic canard|international Jewry]]". The DAP was deeply opposed to the [[Versailles Treaty]].<ref name="RisenFalloftTRp.33"/> The DAP did not attempt to make itself public, and meetings were kept in relative secrecy, with public speakers discussing what they thought of Germany's present [[State of affairs (Sociology)|state of affairs]], or writing to like-minded societies in Northern Germany.<ref name="Face of the 3rd Reich"/>

The DAP was a comparatively small group with fewer than 60 members.<ref name="Face of the 3rd Reich"/> Nevertheless, it attracted the attention of the German authorities, who were suspicious of any organisation that appeared to have subversive tendencies. In July 1919 while stationed in [[Munich]], army ''[[Gefreiter]]'' [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed a ''Verbindungsmann'' (intelligence agent) of the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' (army) by the head of press and [[propaganda]] in the Bavarian section, [[Karl Mayr|Captain Mayr]].<ref name="RisenFallofN.Germanypg.88"/> Hitler's assignment was to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the DAP.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=82}} While attending a party meeting on 12 September 1919, Hitler became involved in a heated argument with a visitor, Professor Baumann, who questioned the soundness of [[Gottfried Feder]]'s arguments against capitalism and proposed that [[Bavaria]] should break away from [[Prussia]] and found a new South German nation with [[Austria]]. In vehemently attacking the man's arguments, he made an impression on the other party members with his oratory skills and, according to Hitler, the "professor" left the hall acknowledging unequivocal defeat.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=75}} According to [[August Kubizek]], Drexler was so impressed that he whispered to a neighbour, "My he's got a gift of the gab. We could use him."<ref name="Face of the 3rd Reich"/> Drexler invited him to join, and Hitler accepted.{{sfn|Stackelberg|2007|p=9}} In less than a week, Hitler received a postcard from Drexler stating he had officially been accepted as a DAP member.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=75, 76}} Among the party's earlier members were [[Ernst Röhm]] of the Army's District Command VII; well-to-do journalist Dietrich Eckart; then [[University of Munich]] student [[Rudolf Hess]];<ref name="RisenFalloftTRp.43"/> ''[[Freikorps]]'' soldier [[Hans Frank]]; and [[Alfred Rosenberg]], often credited as the philosopher of the movement. All were later prominent in the Nazi regime.<ref name="RisenFallofN.Germanypg.88"/>
[[File:Hitler's DAP membership card.png|thumb|Hitler's membership card in the DAP (later NSDAP)]]
Hitler became the DAP's 55th member and received the number 555, as the DAP added '500' to every member's number to exaggerate the party's strength.<ref name="Adolf Hitler: The Definitive Biography"/> He later claimed to be the seventh party member (he was in fact the seventh executive member of the party's central committee;<ref name="WarningfromHistory"/> he would later wear the [[Golden Party Badge]] number one). Hitler's first speech was held in the [[Hofbräukeller]], where he spoke in front of 111 people as the second speaker of the evening. Hitler later declared that this was when he realised he could really "make a good speech".<ref name="Face of the 3rd Reich"/> At first Hitler only spoke to relatively small groups, but his considerable oratory and propaganda skills were appreciated by the party leadership. With the support of Anton Drexler, Hitler became chief of propaganda for the party in early 1920.<ref name="RisenFallofN.Germanypg.89"/> Hitler began to make the party more public, and he organised their biggest meeting yet of 2,000 people, on 24 February 1920 in the ''Staatliches Hofbräuhaus in München''. Such was the significance of this particular move in publicity that [[Karl Harrer|Harrer]] resigned from the party in disagreement.<ref name="RisenFalloftTRp.36"/> It was in this speech that Hitler, for the first time, enunciated the [[National Socialist Program#German Party program|twenty-five points of the ''German Worker's Party'''s manifesto]] that had been drawn up by Drexler, Feder, and Hitler.<ref name="RisenFalloftTRp.37"/> Through these points he gave the organisation a much bolder stratagem<ref name="RisenFallofN.Germanypg.89"/> with a clear foreign policy (abrogation of [[The Treaty of Versailles]], a [[German question|Greater Germany]], Eastern expansion, exclusion of Jews from citizenship), and among his specific points were: confiscation of [[War profiteering|war profits]], abolition of unearned incomes, the State to share profits of land, and land for national needs to be taken away without compensation.<ref name="HistoryoftheModernWorldpg.133"/> In general, the manifesto was [[antisemitic]], [[anti-capitalist]], [[Aristocracy (class)|anti-democratic]], [[anti-Marxist]], and [[Fascism|anti-liberal]].<ref name="Face of the 3rd Reichpg.42"/> To increase its appeal to larger segments of the population, on 24 February 1920, the same day as Hitler's ''Hofbräuhaus'' speech, the DAP changed its name to the ''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'' (National Socialist German Workers Party).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=87}} That year, the Nazi Party officially announced that only persons of "pure Aryan descent [''rein arischer abkunft'']" could become party members; if the person had a spouse, they also had to be a "racially pure" Aryan. Party members could not be related either directly or indirectly to a so-called "non-Aryan".<ref name="Ehrenreich2007">{{cite book|author = Eric Ehrenreich | title = The Nazi Ancestral Proof: Genealogy, Racial Science, and the Final Solution| year = 2007 | publisher = Indiana University Press | isbn = 0-253-11687-2 | page = 58}}</ref>

Hitler quickly became the party's most active orator, and he appeared in public as a speaker thirty-one times within the first year after his self-discovery.<ref name="Fest1972"/> Hitler's considerable oratory and propaganda skills were appreciated by the party leadership as crowds began to flock to hear his speeches.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=89}} Hitler always spoke about the same subjects: the Treaty of Versailles and [[the Jewish question]].<ref name="Face of the 3rd Reichpg.42"/> This deliberate technique and effective publicising of the party contributed significantly to his early success,<ref name="Face of the 3rd Reichpg.42"/> about which a contemporary poster wrote 'Since Herr Hitler is a brilliant speaker, we can hold out the prospect of an extremely exciting evening'.<ref name="hilterbewegung"/> Over the following months, the party continued to attract new members,<ref name="WarningfromHistory"/> while remaining too small to have any real significance in German politics.<ref name="RisenFalloftTRp.38"/> By the end of the year, party membership was recorded at 2,000.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=89}} Many of whom Hitler and Röhm had brought into the party personally, or for whom Hitler's oratory had been their reason for joining.<ref name="Face of the 3rd Reichpg.40"/>

Hitler's talent as an orator, and his ability to draw new members, combined with his characteristic ruthlessness, soon made him the dominant figure. However, while Hitler was on a fundraising trip to Berlin in June 1921, a mutiny broke out within the Nazi Party in Munich. Members of its executive committee, some of whom considered Hitler to be too overbearing, wanted to merge with the rival [[German Socialist Party]] (DSP).{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=100, 101}} Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation. The committee members realised that his resignation would mean the end of the party.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=102}} Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman, and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=103}} The committee agreed, and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3,680. He still faced some opposition from other members: Opponents of Hitler had [[Hermann Esser]] expelled from the party and they printed 3,000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=103}} In the following days, Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and Esser, to thunderous applause.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=83, 103}}

Hitler was formally elected party chairman on 28 July 1921, with only one opposing vote.  The committee was dissolved, and Hitler was granted nearly absolute powers as the party's sole leader.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=83, 103}} This was a post he would hold for the remainder of his life.  Hitler soon acquired the title ''[[Führer]]'' ("leader") and, after a series of sharp internal conflicts, it was accepted that the party would be governed by the ''[[Führerprinzip]]'' ("leader principle").  Under this principle, the party was a highly centralized entity that functioned strictly from the top down, with Hitler at the apex as the party's absolute leader.  Hitler at this time saw the party as a revolutionary organization, whose aim was the overthrow of the [[Weimar Republic]], which he saw as controlled by the socialists, Jews and the "[[Stab-in-the-back legend|November criminals]]" who had betrayed the German soldiers in 1918. The [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] ("storm troopers", also known as "Brownshirts") were founded as a party militia in 1921, and began violent attacks on other parties.
[[File:Erstausgabe von Mein Kampf.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Mein Kampf]]'' in its first edition cover.]]

For Hitler, the twin goals of the party were always German nationalist expansionism and [[antisemitism]]. These two goals were fused in his mind by his belief that Germany's external enemies&nbsp;– Britain, France and the Soviet Union&nbsp;– were controlled by the Jews, and that Germany's future wars of national expansion would necessarily entail a war against the Jews.<ref name="A History of Us: War, Peace and all that Jazz"/> For Hitler and his principal lieutenants, national and racial issues were always dominant. This was symbolised by the adoption as the party emblem of the [[swastika]] or ''Hakenkreuz'', at the time [[Western use of the swastika in the early 20th century|widely used in the western world]]. In German nationalist circles, the swastika was considered a symbol of an "[[Aryan race]]"; it symbolized the replacement of the Christian Cross with allegiance to a National Socialist State.

During 1921 and 1922, the Nazi Party grew significantly, partly through Hitler's oratorical skills, partly through the SA's appeal to unemployed young men, and partly because there was a backlash against socialist and liberal politics in Bavaria as Germany's economic problems deepened and the weakness of the Weimar regime became apparent. The party recruited former World War&nbsp;I soldiers, to whom Hitler as a decorated frontline veteran could particularly appeal, as well as small businessmen and disaffected former members of rival parties. Nazi rallies were often held in beer halls, where downtrodden men could get free beer. The [[Hitler Youth]] was formed for the children of party members, although it remained small until the late 1920s. The party also formed groups in other parts of Germany. [[Julius Streicher]] in [[Nuremberg]] was an early recruit, and became editor of the racist magazine ''[[Der Stürmer]]''. Others to join the party around this time were WW&nbsp;I flying ace [[Hermann Göring]] and [[Heinrich Himmler]]. In December 1920 the Nazi Party acquired a newspaper, the ''[[Völkischer Beobachter]]'', of which its leading ideologist [[Alfred Rosenberg]] became editor.

In 1922, a party with remarkably similar policies and objectives came into power in Italy, the [[National Fascist Party]] under the leadership of the charismatic [[Benito Mussolini]]. The Fascists, like the Nazis, promoted a national rebirth of their country; opposed communism and liberalism; appealed to the working-class; opposed the [[Treaty of Versailles]]; and advocated the territorial expansion of their country. The Italian Fascists used a straight-armed [[Roman salute]] and wore black-shirted uniforms. Hitler was inspired by Mussolini and the Fascists, borrowing their use of the straight-armed salute as a Nazi salute. When the Fascists came to power in 1922 in Italy through their coup attempt called the "[[March on Rome]]", Hitler began planning his own coup which would materialize one year later.

In January 1923, France occupied the [[Ruhr]] industrial region as a result of Germany's failure to meet its [[World War I reparations|reparations]] payments. This led to economic chaos, the resignation of [[Wilhelm Cuno]]'s government, and an attempt by the German Communist Party (KPD) to stage a revolution. The reaction to these events was an upsurge of nationalist sentiment. Nazi Party membership grew sharply, to about 20,000.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=110}} By November, Hitler had decided that the time was right for an attempt to seize power in Munich, in the hope that the [[Reichswehr]] (the post-war German military) would mutiny against the Berlin government and join his revolt. In this he was influenced by former General [[Erich Ludendorff]], who had become a supporter—though not a member—of the Nazis.

On the night of 8 November, the Nazis used a patriotic rally in a Munich beer hall to launch an attempted ''putsch'' (''coup d'état''). This so-called [[Beer Hall Putsch]] attempt failed almost at once when the local Reichswehr commanders refused to support it. On the morning of 9 November the Nazis staged a march of about 2,000 supporters through Munich in an attempt to rally support. Troops opened fire, and 16 Nazis were killed. Hitler, Ludendorff and a number of others were arrested, and were tried for treason in March 1924. Hitler and his associates were given very lenient prison sentences. While Hitler was in prison, he wrote his semi-autobiographical political manifesto ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' ("My Struggle").{{sfn|Hitler|1998}}

The Nazi Party was banned, though with support of the nationalist [[Völkisch-Social Bloc]] (''Völkisch-Sozialer Block''), continued to operate under the name of the "German Party" (''Deutsche Partei'' or DP) from 1924 to 1925.<ref name="dissolution"/> The Nazis failed to remain unified in the German Party, as in the north, the right-wing [[Völkisch movement|Volkish]] nationalist supporters of the Nazis moved to the new [[German Völkisch Freedom Party]], leaving the north's left-wing Nazi members, such as [[Joseph Goebbels]] retaining support for the party.<ref name="jablonsky"/>

===Rise to power: 1925–1933===

{{Further|Adolf Hitler's rise to power}}

Adolf Hitler was released in December 1924. In the following year he re-founded and reorganized the Nazi Party, with himself as its undisputed Leader. The new Nazi Party was no longer a paramilitary organization, and disavowed any intention of taking power by force. In any case, the economic and political situation had stabilized and the extremist upsurge of 1923 had faded, so there was no prospect of further revolutionary adventures. The Nazi Party of 1925 was divided into the "Leadership Corps" (''Korps der politischen Leiter''), appointed by Hitler, and the general membership (''Parteimitglieder''). The party and the SA were kept separate, and the legal aspect of the party's work was emphasized. In a sign of this, the party began to admit women. The SA and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] (founded in April 1925 as Hitler's bodyguard, commanded by Himmler) were described as "support groups", and all members of these groups had first to become regular party members.

In the 1920s the Nazi party expanded beyond its Bavarian base. Catholic Bavaria maintained its right-wing nostalgia for a Catholic monarch; and [[Westphalia]], along with working-class "Red Berlin", were always the Nazis' weakest areas electorally, even during the Third Reich itself. The areas of strongest Nazi support were in rural Protestant areas such as [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Mecklenburg]], [[Pomerania]], and [[East Prussia]]. Depressed working-class areas such as [[Thuringia]] also produced a strong Nazi vote, while the workers of the [[Ruhr]] and [[Hamburg]] largely remained loyal to the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratics]], the [[Communist Party of Germany]], or the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]]. Nuremberg remained a Nazi Party stronghold, and the first [[Nuremberg Rally]] was held there in 1927. These rallies soon became massive displays of Nazi paramilitary power and attracted many recruits. The Nazis' strongest appeal was to the lower middle-classes&nbsp;– farmers, public servants, teachers, small businessmen&nbsp;– who had suffered most from the inflation of the 1920s, so who feared Bolshevism more than anything else. The small business class was receptive to Hitler's antisemitism, since it blamed Jewish big business for its economic problems. University students, disappointed at being too young to have served in the War of 1914–1918, and attracted by the Nazis' radical rhetoric, also became a strong Nazi constituency. By 1929, the party had 130,000 members.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=194}}

The party's nominal Deputy Leader was [[Rudolf Hess]], but he had no real power in the party. By the early 1930s the senior leaders of the party after Hitler were [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]], [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] and [[Hermann Göring|Göring]]. Beneath the Leadership Corps were the party's regional leaders, the ''[[Gauleiter]]s'', each of whom commanded the party in his ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]]'' ("region"). [[Joseph Goebbels]] began his ascent through the party hierarchy as ''Gauleiter'' of Berlin-Brandenburg in 1926. Streicher was ''Gauleiter'' of [[Franconia]], where he published his antisemitic newspaper ''[[Der Stürmer]]''. Beneath the ''Gauleiter'' were lower-level officials, the ''[[Kreisleiter]]'' ("county leaders"), ''[[Zellenleiter]]'' ("cell leaders") and ''[[Blockleiter]]'' ("block leaders"). This was a strictly hierarchical structure in which orders flowed from the top, and unquestioning loyalty was given to superiors. Only the SA retained some autonomy. Being composed largely of unemployed workers, many SA men took the Nazis' socialist rhetoric seriously. At this time, the [[Hitler salute]] (borrowed from the [[Italian Fascism|Italian fascists]]) and the greeting "Heil Hitler!" were adopted throughout the party. 

[[File:1930-election.jpg|thumb|Nazi Party election poster used in [[Vienna]] in 1930. Translation: "We demand freedom and bread".]]
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Vote number 1b.jpg|thumb|Political poster for the November 1932 [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] election. The text, ''Das Volk wählt Liste 1 Nationalsozialisten Reichstagswahl'', may be translated "The nation is voting for List 1. National Socialists. Reichstag election, 6.11.32" or "The People Choose List 1: National Socialists".]] -->

The Nazis contested elections to the national parliament, the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'', and to the state legislatures, the ''[[Landtag]]s'', from 1924, although at first with little success. The "National-Socialist Freedom Movement" polled 3% of the vote in the [[German election, December 1924|December 1924 ''Reichstag'' elections]], and this fell to 2.6% in [[German election, 1928|1928]]. State elections produced similar results. Despite these poor results, and despite Germany's relative political stability and prosperity during the later 1920s, the Nazi Party continued to grow. This was partly because Hitler, who had no administrative ability, left the party organization to the head of the secretariat, [[Philipp Bouhler]], the party treasurer [[Franz Xaver Schwarz]], and business manager [[Max Amann]]. The party had a capable propaganda head in [[Gregor Strasser]], who was promoted to national organizational leader in January 1928. These men gave the party efficient recruitment and organizational structures. The party also owed its growth to the gradual fading away of competitor nationalist groups, such as the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP). As Hitler became the recognized head of the German nationalists, other groups declined or were absorbed.

Despite these strengths, the Nazi Party might never have come to power had it not been for the [[Great Depression]] and its effects on Germany. By 1930 the German economy was beset with mass unemployment and widespread business failures. The Social Democrats and Communists were bitterly divided and unable to formulate an effective solution: this gave the Nazis their opportunity, and Hitler's message, blaming the crisis on the Jewish financiers and the Bolsheviks, resonated with wide sections of the electorate. At the [[German election, 1930|September 1930 ''Reichstag'' elections]], the Nazis won 18.3% of the votes and became the second-largest party in the ''Reichstag'' after the SPD. Hitler proved to be a highly effective campaigner, pioneering the use of radio and aircraft for this purpose. His dismissal of Strasser and his appointment of Goebbels as the party's propaganda chief were major factors. While Strasser had used his position to promote his own leftish version of national socialism, Goebbels was totally loyal to Hitler and worked only to improve Hitler's image.

The 1930 elections changed the German political landscape by weakening the traditional nationalist parties, the DNVP and the DVP, leaving the Nazis as the chief alternative to the discredited SPD and the Zentrum, whose leader, [[Heinrich Brüning]], headed a weak minority government. The inability of the democratic parties to form a united front, the self-imposed isolation of the Communists, and the continued decline of the economy, all played into Hitler's hands. He now came to be seen as ''de facto'' leader of the opposition, and donations poured into the Nazi Party's coffers. Some major business figures, such as [[Fritz Thyssen]], were Nazi supporters and gave generously,{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=372}} and some Wall Street figures were allegedly involved,<ref name="reformed-theology"/> but many other businessmen were suspicious of the extreme nationalist tendencies of the Nazis and preferred to support the traditional conservative parties instead.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=224}}

During 1931 and into 1932, Germany's political crisis deepened. In March 1932 Hitler ran for President against the incumbent President [[Paul von Hindenburg]], polling 30.1% in the first round and 36.8% in the second against Hindenburg's 49 and 53%. By now the SA had 400,000 members, and its running street battles with the SPD and Communist paramilitaries (who also fought each other) reduced some German cities to combat zones. Paradoxically, although the Nazis were among the main instigators of this disorder, part of Hitler's appeal to a frightened and demoralised middle class was his promise to restore law and order. Overt antisemitism was played down in official Nazi rhetoric, but was never far from the surface. Germans voted for Hitler primarily because of his promises to revive the economy (by unspecified means), to restore German greatness and overturn the [[Treaty of Versailles]], and to save Germany from communism.

On 20 July 1932, the Prussian government was ousted by a coup, the ''Preussenschlag'', and a few days later at the [[German election, July 1932|July 1932 ''Reichstag'' election]] the Nazis made another leap forward, polling 37.4% and becoming the largest party in parliament by a wide margin. Furthermore, the Nazis and the Communists between them won 52% of the vote and a majority of seats. Since both parties opposed the established political system, and neither would join or support any ministry, this made the formation of a majority government impossible. The result was weak ministries governing by decree. Under [[Comintern]] directives, the Communists maintained their policy of treating the SPD as the main enemy, calling them "[[social fascism|social fascists]]", thereby splintering opposition to the Nazis.<ref name="correspondence"/> Later, both the SPD and the Communists accused each other of having facilitated [[Hitler's rise to power]] by their unwillingness to compromise.

Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] called another ''Reichstag'' election in November, hoping to find a way out of this impasse. The electoral result was the same, with the Nazis and the Communists winning 50% of the vote between them and more than half the seats, rendering this ''Reichstag'' no more workable than its predecessor. But support for the Nazis had fallen to 33.1%, suggesting that the Nazi surge had passed its peak&nbsp;– possibly because the worst of the Depression had passed, possibly because some middle-class voters had supported Hitler in July as a protest, but had now drawn back from the prospect of actually putting him into power. The Nazis interpreted the result as a warning that they must seize power before their moment passed. Had the other parties united, this could have been prevented, but their shortsightedness made a united front impossible. Papen, his successor [[Kurt von Schleicher]], and the nationalist press magnate [[Alfred Hugenberg]] spent December and January in political intrigues that eventually persuaded President Hindenburg that it was safe to appoint Hitler as Reich Chancellor, at the head of a cabinet including only a minority of Nazi ministers—which he did on 30 January 1933.

Hitler in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' directly attacked both left-wing and right-wing politics in Germany.<ref name="politicians"/> However, a majority of scholars identify Nazism in practice as being a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] form of politics.<ref name="Fritzsche, Peter 1998" /> When asked in an interview whether he and the Nazis were "bourgeois right-wing" as alleged by their opponents, Hitler responded that Nazism was not exclusively for any class, and indicated that it favoured neither the left nor the right, but preserved "pure" elements from both "camps", stating: "From the camp of bourgeois tradition, it takes national resolve, and from the materialism of the Marxist dogma, living, creative Socialism."<ref name="commentary"/>

The votes that the Nazis received in the 1932 elections established the Nazi Party as the largest parliamentary faction of the Weimar Republic government. Adolf Hitler was appointed as [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]] on 30 January 1933.

The [[Reichstag fire|''Reichstag'' fire]] on 27 February 1933 gave Hitler a ''raison d'état'' for suppressing his political opponents. The following day, 28 February, he persuaded Weimar Republic President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] to issue the [[Reichstag Fire Decree|''Reichstag'' Fire Decree]], which suspended most [[civil liberties]]. On 23 March, the ''Reichstag'' passed the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], which gave the cabinet the right to enact laws without the consent of parliament.  In effect, this gave Hitler dictatorial powers.  Now possessing virtually absolute power, the Nazis established [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] control; they abolished labour unions and other political parties and imprisoned their political opponents, first at ''wilde Lager'', improvised camps, then in [[concentration camp]]s. Nazism had been established, yet the ''Reichswehr'' remained impartial: Nazi power over Germany remained virtual, not absolute.

==Political program==
{{Main|National Socialist Program}}
The National Socialist Program was a formulation of the policies of the party. It contained 25 points and is thus also known as the '25 point plan' or the '25 point program'. It was the official party program, with minor changes, from its proclamation as such by Hitler in 1920, when the party was still the German Workers' Party, until its dissolution.

==Party composition==

===Command structure===

====Top leadership====
At the top of the Nazi Party was the party chairman ("''Der Führer''"), who held absolute power and full command over the party. All other party offices were subordinate to his position and had to depend on his instructions. In 1934, Hitler founded a separate body for the chairman, [[Hitler's Chancellery (Kanzlei des Führers)|Chancellery of the Führer]], with its own sub-units.

Below the Führer's chancellery was first the "Staff of the Deputy Führer" (headed by Rudolf Hess from 21 April 1933 to 10 May 1941) and then the "Party Chancellery" (''[[Parteikanzlei]]'') headed by Martin Bormann.

====Reichsleiter====
Directly subjected to the Führer were the ''[[Reichsleiter]]'' ("Reich Leader(s)"—the singular and plural forms are identical in German), whose number was gradually increased to eighteen. They held power and influence comparable to the Reich Ministers' in [[Cabinet Hitler|Hitler's Cabinet]]. The eighteen ''Reichsleiter'' formed the "Reich Leadership of the Nazi Party" (''Reichsleitung der NSDAP''), which was established at the so-called [[Brown House, Munich, Germany|Brown House]], in Munich. Unlike a Gauleiter, a Reichsleiter did not have individual geographic areas under their command, but were responsible for specific spheres of interest.

====Political leadership corps====
The political leadership corps of the Nazi Party were those persons who were most often associated as being "Nazis" in the stereotypical sense of the word, as it was these individuals who wore brown paramilitary Nazi uniforms, enforced Nazi doctrine, and ran local government affairs in accordance with instructions from the Nazi Party.<ref name="encyclopedia"/>

The political leadership corps encompassed a vast array of [[ranks and insignia of the Nazi Party|paramilitary titles]] at the top of which were [[Gauleiter]], who were Party leaders of large geographical areas. From the Gauleiters extended downwards through Nazi positions encompassing county, city, and town leaders, all of whom were unquestioned rulers in their particular areas and regions.<ref name="uniformen"/>

To the very end of its existence, the Nazi Party claimed to respect the traditional government of Germany and, to that end, local and state governments were allowed to exist side-by-side with regional Nazi leaders. However, by 1936, the local governments had lost nearly all power to their Nazi counterparts or were now controlled by persons who held both government and Nazi titles alike. This led to the continued existence of German titles such as ''[[Burgomaster|Bürgermeister]]'', as well as the existence of German state legislatures (''[[legislature|Landesrat]]''), but without any real power to speak of.<ref name="macmillan8"/>

==== Ordinary members ====

The general Nazi Party membership were known by the title of ''Parteimitglieder''. This generic term applied to any member of the Party who did not otherwise hold a political leadership position. Translated simply as "Party Member", the ''Parteimitglieder'' could (and did) hold positions in other Nazi groups, such as the [[SS]] or [[Sturmabteilung]]. The only insignia for the ''Parteimitglieder'' was a Nazi Party lapel-pin; Nazi Party members who held no leadership posts had no specific designated uniform. Such persons, however, often wore uniforms of other Nazi groups, uniforms of German government agencies, and could also serve in the German armed forces.

===Nazi Party offices===
{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}
The Nazi Party had a number of party offices dealing with various political and other matters. These included:

* ''[[NSDAP Office of Racial Policy|Rassenpolitisches Amt der NSDAP]]'' (RPA): "NSDAP Office of Racial Policy"
* ''[[NSDAP Office of Foreign Affairs|Außenpolitische Amt der NSDAP]]'' (APA): "NSDAP Office of Foreign Affairs"
* ''[[NSDAP Office of Colonial Policy|Kolonialpolitisches Amt der NSDAP]]'' (KPA): "NSDAP Office of Colonial Policy"
* ''[[NSDAP Office of Military Policy|Wehrpolitisches Amt der NSDAP]]'' (WPA): "NSDAP Office of Military Policy"
* ''[[Amt Rosenberg]]'' (ARo): "[[Alfred Rosenberg|Rosenberg]] Office"

===Paramilitary groups===
In addition to the Nazi Party proper, several paramilitary groups existed which "supported" Nazi aims. All members of these paramilitary organizations were required to become regular Nazi Party members first and could then enlist in the group of their choice. A vast system of [[Nazi party paramilitary ranks]] developed for each of the various paramilitary groups.

The major Nazi Party paramilitary groups were as follows:
* ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS): "Protection Squadron" (both [[Allgemeine SS]] and [[Waffen-SS]])
* ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA): "Storm Division"
* ''[[National Socialist Flyers Corps|Nationalsozialistisches Fliegerkorps]]'' (NSFK): "National Socialist Flyers Corps"
* ''[[National Socialist Motor Corps|Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrerkorps]]'' (NSKK): "National Socialist Motor Corps"

The [[Hitler Youth]] was a paramilitary group divided into an adult leadership corps and a general membership open to boys aged fourteen to eighteen. The [[League of German Girls]] was the equivalent group for girls.

===Affiliated organizations===
Certain nominally independent organizations had their own legal representation and own property, but were supported by the Nazi Party. Many of these associated organizations were labor unions of various professions. Some were older organizations that were nazified according to the ''Gleichschaltung'' policy after the 1933 takeover:
* Reich League of German Officials (union of civil servants, predecessor to [[German Civil Service Federation]])
* [[German Labor Front]] (DAF)
* National Socialist German Physicians' League (NSDÄB)
* National Socialist League for the Maintenance of the Law (NSRB, 1936–1945, earlier National Socialist German Lawyers' League)
* [[NSKOV|National Socialist War Victim's Care]] (NSKOV)
* [[National Socialist Teachers League]] (NSLB)
* [[National Socialist People's Welfare]] (NSV)
* [[Reich Labor Service]] (RAD)
* [[German Faith Movement]]
* [[German Colonial League]] (RKB)
* [[German Red Cross]]
* [[Kyffhäuserbund|Kyffhäuser League]]
* [[TENO|Technical Emergency Relief]] (TENO)
* [[Reichsbund der Kinderreichen|Reich's Union of Large Families]]
* [[Reichsluftschutzbund]] (RLB)
* [[Reichskolonialbund]] (RKB)
* [[Bund Deutscher Osten]] (BDO)
* [[German American Bund]]

==Regional administration==
[[File:Nsdap gaue english.png|thumb|200px|left|Party Gaue in 1926, 1928, 1933, 1937, 1939 and 1943]]
[[File:NS administrative Gliederung 1944.png|thumb|right|200px|Administrative units of the Nazi Party in 1944.]]
{{See also|Administrative divisions of Nazi Germany|List of Gauleiters}}

For the purpose of centralization in the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' process a rigidly hierarchal structure was established in the Nazi Party, which it later carried through in the whole of Germany in order consolidate total power under the person of [[Hitler]] (''Führerstaat''). It was regionally sub-divided into a number of ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gaue]]'' (singular: ''Gau'') headed by a ''[[Gauleiter]]'', who received their orders directly from Hitler. The name (originally a term for sub-regions of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] headed by a ''Gaugraf'') for these new provincial structures was deliberately chosen because of its [[Middle Ages|mediaeval]] connotations. The term is approximately equivalent to the English ''[[shire]]''.

After the [[Anschluss]] a new type of administrative unit was introduced called a ''[[Reichsgau]]''. In these territories the Gauleiters also held the position of [[Reichsstatthalter]], thereby formally combining the spheres of both party and state offices. The establishment of this type of district was subsequently carried out for any further territorial annexations of Germany both before and during [[World War II]].

The ''Gaue'' and ''Reichsgaue'' (state or province) were further sub-divided into ''[[Districts of Germany|Kreise]]'' (counties) headed by a ''Kreisleiter'', which were in turn sub-divided into ''Zellen'' (cells) and ''Blocken'' (blocks), headed by a ''Zellenleiter'' and ''Blockleiter'' respectively.

A reorganization of the ''Gaue'' was enacted on 1 October 1928. The given numbers were the official ordering numbers. The statistics are from 1941, for which the ''Gau'' organization of that moment in time forms the basis. Their size and populations are not exact; for instance according to the official party statistics the ''Gau'' Kurmark/Mark Brandenburg was the largest in the German Reich.<ref name="google"/> By 1941, there were 42 territorial ''Gaue'' for Germany,<ref>The 43rd ''Gau'' known as the [[NSDAP/AO|Auslandsorganisation]] is non-territorial.</ref> 7 of them for Austria, the [[Sudetenland]] (in [[Czechoslovakia]]), [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]],  and the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]], along with the unincorporated regions under German control known as the Protectorate of Bohemia-Moravia and the General Government of Poland.<ref>German Historical Institute (2008). "Administrative Structure under National Socialism (1941)" Washington DC. Map retrievable at: http://www.germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/map.cfm?map_id=2885  (accessed January 09, 2014)</ref> Getting the leadership of the individual ''Gaue'' to cooperate with one another proved difficult at times since there was constant administrative and financial jockeying for control going on between them.<ref>Martin Broszat, ''The Hitler State: The Foundation and Development of the Internal Structure of the Third Reich'' (London and New York: Longman, 1985), pp. 44-47.</ref>

The table below uses the organizational structure that existed before its dissolution in 1945. More information on the older ''Gaue'' is in the second table.

===Associated organizations abroad===
{{See also|NSDAP/AO}}

====''Gaue'' in Switzerland====
The irregular [[Switzerland|Swiss]] branch of the Nazi Party also established a number of Party ''[[Gaue]]'' in that country, most of them named after their regional capitals. These included ''Gau [[Canton of Basel|Basel]]-[[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]]'', ''Gau [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]]'', ''Gau [[Canton of Luzern|Luzern]]'', ''Gau [[Canton of Bern|Bern]]'' and ''Gau [[Canton of Zürich|Zürich]]''.<ref name="google9"/><ref name="Examples of NSDAP and National Front meetings and agendas in northern Switzerland, 1935, 1937"/><ref name="Archiv des Historischen Vereins des Kantons Bern, vol 57–60"/> The cantons of [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]], [[Canton of Thurgau|Thurgau]] und [[Canton of Appenzell|Appenzell]] were administered under ''Gau Ostschweiz'' (East Switzerland).<ref name="Die Nationale front"/>

==Membership==

===General membership===
[[File:Parteibuch der NSDAP.jpg|thumb|Membership of the Nazi Party from 1939.]]
{{main|List of Nazi Party members}}
The general membership of the Nazi Party mainly consisted of the urban and rural [[lower middle class]]es. 7% belonged to the upper class, another 7% were [[peasant]]s, 35% were industrial workers and 51% were what can be described as middle class. In early 1933, just before Hitler's appointment to the chancellorship, the party showed an under-representation of "workers", who made up 29.7% of the membership but 46.3% of German society. Conversely, white-collar employees (18.6% of members and 12% of Germans), the self-employed (19.8% of members and 9.6% of Germans), and civil servants (15.2% of members and 4.8% of the German population) had joined in proportions greater than their share of the general population.<ref name="republic"/> These members were affiliated with local branches of the party, of which there were 1,378 throughout the country in 1928. In 1932, the number had risen to 11,845, reflecting the party's growth in this period.{{sfn|Panayi|2007|p=40}}

When it came to power in 1933, the Nazi Party had over {{Nowrap|2 million}} members. In 1939, the membership total rose to 5.3 million with 81% being male and 19% being female. It continued to attract many more and by 1945 the party reached its peak of 8 million with 63% being male and 37% being female.<ref name="hitler"/>

===Military membership===
Nazi members with military ambitions were encouraged to join the ''[[Waffen-SS]]'', but a great number enlisted in the ''Wehrmacht'' and even more were drafted for service after [[World War&nbsp;II]] began. Early regulations required that all ''Wehrmacht'' members be non-political, and therefore any Nazi member joining in the 1930s was required to resign from the Nazi Party.

This regulation was soon waived, however, and there is ample evidence that full Nazi Party members served in the ''Wehrmacht'' in particular after the outbreak of World War&nbsp;II. The ''Wehrmacht'' Reserves also saw a high number of senior Nazis enlisting, with [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and [[Fritz Todt]] joining the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', as well as [[Karl Hanke]] who served in the army.

===Student membership===
In 1926, the party formed a special division to engage the student population, known as the [[National Socialist German Students' League]] (NSDStB). A group for university lecturers, the [[National Socialist German University Lecturers' League]] (NSDDB), also existed until July 1944.

===Women membership===
The [[NS-Frauenschaft|National Socialist Women's League]] was the [[women's wing|women's organization]] of the party. By 1938 it had approximately 2 million members.

===Membership outside of Germany===
Party members who lived outside of Germany were pooled into the ''Auslands-Organisation'' ([[NSDAP/AO]], "Foreign Organization"). The organization was limited only to so-called "[[Imperial Germans]]"; "Ethnic Germans" (''[[Volksdeutsche]]'') who did not hold German citizenship were not permitted to join.

Under [[Beneš decrees|Beneš decree]] [[Beneš decrees#List of decrees|No. 16/1945 Coll.]], in case of citizens of Czechoslovakia, membership of the Nazi Party was punishable by between five and twenty years of imprisonment.

====''Deutsche Gemeinschaft''====
''Deutsche Gemeinschaft'' was a branch of the Nazi Party founded in 1919, created for Germans with ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'' status.<ref name="Fakty"/> It is not to be confused with the post-war right-wing ''Deutsche Gemeinschaft'' party (see [[:de:Deutsche Gemeinschaft]]) founded in 1949.

Notable members included:<ref name="gemeinschaft">Wolfgang Rosar: ''Deutsche Gemeinschaft. Seyss-Inquart und der Anschluß''. Europa-Verlag, Wien 1971. ISBN 3-203-50384-0.</ref>
* [[Oswald Menghin]] ([[Vienna]])
* [[Herbert Czaja]] ([[Province of Silesia]] inside [[Prussia]])
* [[Hermann Neubacher]] who was responsible for invading Yugoslavia.
* [[Rudolf Much]] ([[Vienna]])
* [[Arthur Seyß-Inquart]] ([[Vienna]])

==Party symbols==
* [[Flag of Germany|Nazi flags]]: The Nazi party used a right-facing [[swastika]] as their symbol and the red and black colours were said to represent ''[[Blood and soil|Blut und Boden]]'' ("blood and soil"). Another definition of the flag describes the colours as representing the ideology of National Socialism, the swastika representing the Aryan race and the Aryan nationalist agenda of the movement; white representing Aryan racial purity; and red representing the socialist agenda of the movement. Black, white and red were in fact the colours of the old [[North German Confederation]] flag (invented by [[Otto von Bismarck]], based on the Prussian colours black and white and the red used by northern German states). In 1871, with the foundation of the German Reich, the flag of the North German Confederation became the German ''Reichsflagge'' ("Reich's flag"). Black, white and red became the colours of the nationalists through the following history (for example [[World War I]] and the [[Weimar Republic]]).

:The [[:File:Flag of the NSDAP (1920–1945).svg|''Parteiflagge'']] design, with the centered swastika disc, served as the party flag since 1920. Between 1933 (when the Nazi Party came to power) and 1935, it was used as the National flag (''Nationalflagge'') and Merchant flag (''Handelsflagge''), but interchangeably with the [[:File:Flag of German Reich (1933–1935).svg|black-white-red horizontal tricolour]]. In 1935, the black-white-red horizontal tricolour was scrapped (again), and the [[:File:Flag of German Reich (1935–1945).svg|flag with the ''off-center'' swastika and disc]] was instituted as the only national flag, and was to remain as such until 1945. The flag with the ''centered'' disk continued to be used after 1935, but exclusively as the ''Parteiflagge'', the flag of the party.
* [[Coat of arms of Germany|German eagle]]: The Nazi party used the traditional [[Coat of arms of Germany|German eagle]], standing atop of a [[swastika]] inside a wreath of oak leaves. It is also known as the ''Iron Eagle.'' When the eagle is looking to its left shoulder, it symbolises the Nazi party, and was called the ''Parteiadler''. In contrast, when the eagle is looking to its right shoulder, it symbolises the country (''[[Reich]]''), and was therefore called the ''[[Reichsadler]]''. After the Nazi party came to power in Germany, they replaced the traditional version of the German eagle with the modified party symbol throughout the country and all its institutions.

"Only" received generally positive reviews from critics. Carolyn Menyes from [[Music Times]] gave the song a positive review, saying "With a cool sense of confidence and rhymes that boast of her own sexual and rapping prowess, Minaj is taking the reins, leading into the equally vulgar and explosive rap verses from Drake and Wayne".<ref>{{cite web|title=REVIEW: Nicki Minaj, Drake, Lil Wayne & Chris Brown Show Confident Presence on "Only" Ahead of 'The Pink Print' Release Date [LISTEN]|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/13687/20141028/review-nicki-minaj-drake-lil-wayne-chris-brown-only-listen.htm|publisher=''Music Times''|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> Brennan Carley from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' said ""Only" is Nicki at her dirtiest and smartest, rapping with metaphors that'd fly over other rappers' heads while keeping the glint of a knowing wink always in her eye."<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicki Minaj Spits Fire on YMCMB Posse Cut, 'Only'|url=http://www.spin.com/articles/nicki-minaj-chris-brown-drake-lil-wayne-only/|publisher=''Spin''|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> Miles Raymer from ''Entertainment Weekly'' praised Minaj's rap and called it the best part of the song.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicki Minaj and some other, less important guys release 'Only'|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2014/10/28/nicki-minaj-drake-lil-wayne-chris-brown-only/|publisher=''Entertainment Weekly''|accessdate=28 October 2014}}</ref> Chris Coplan from Consequence of Sound said although it wasn't the strongest effort from them three, the song was "a great display of how their separate and distinct personalities can still play off one another nicely".<ref>{{cite web|title=Nicki Minaj teams with Drake and Lil Wayne for "Only" — listen|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/10/nicki-minaj-teams-with-drake-and-lil-wayne-for-only-listen/|publisher=''Consequence of Sound''|accessdate= 28 October 2014}}</ref> Drew Millard from Noisey praised Lil Wayne's verse and said "Minaj continues to rap laps around the competition and there's no indication that that's going to change any time soon".<ref>{{cite web|title=LISTEN TO NICKI MINAJ'S "ONLY," FEATURING DRAKE, LIL WAYNE, AND CHRIS BROWN|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/listen-to-nicki-minajs-only-featuring-drake-lil-wayne-and-chris-brown|publisher=''Noisey''|accessdate= 28 October 2014}}</ref>

==Controversy==
Minaj released a lyric music video for the song in early November 2014, premiering close to the 25th anniversary of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], with visualisations inspired by the [[Nazi]] Regime and the work of [[Leni Riefenstahl]].<ref name=billboardvideo>{{cite web|last1=Stutz|first1=Colin|title=Watch Nicki Minaj's Totalitarian 'Only' Lyric Video With Drake, Lil Wayne, Chris Brown|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6312124/nicki-minajs-only-lyric-video-drake-lil-wayne-chris-brown|website=Billboard|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref> There was immediate backlash from fans, calling the video anti-semitic and insensitive.

[[Buzzfeed]] detailed the video, created by Jeff Osborne: "''Nicki is depicted as a powerful military leader in charge of an army that look suspiciously like a bunch SS officers. Red flags that feature a distorted, swastika-looking version of her initials are featured throughout the video. There’s a Nuremberg-esque parking lot for her tanks. And her soldiers are shown wearing Nazi-esque armbands.''"<ref name=buzzfeedvideo>{{cite web|last1=Dunlap|first1=Kelly|title=Nicki Minaj Accused Of Using Nazi Imagery In New Video|url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/kelleydunlap/nicki-minaj-only-video-nazi-imagery|website=Buzzfeed|publisher=Buzzfeed|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref> Osborne was inspired by conspiracy theorist [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]] in his creation of the video.<ref>http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/11/nicki-minaj-nazi-video-was-inspired-by-hero-alex-jones-director-reveals/</ref> [[Gawker]] pointed out that although Nicki Minaj is not the first entertainer to derive inspiration from Nazi imagery, "generally artists have refrained from using comparisons to Hitler's regime as a compliment."<ref name=gawkervideo>{{cite web|last1=Hongo|first1=Hudson|title=Critics Blast Nicki Minaj for Nazi-Inspired Music Video|url=http://gawker.com/critics-blast-nicki-minaj-for-nazi-inspired-music-video-1656595337|website=Gawker|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref> Guest-rapper Drake, who is Jewish, was also criticized for his involvement in the video.<ref name=jpostvideo>{{cite web|title=Nicki Minaj comes under fire for alleged use of Nazi imagery in new music video|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Niki-Minaj-comes-under-fire-for-alleged-use-of-Nazi-imagery-in-new-music-video-381255|website=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>

Minaj later issued a statement on the video via her Twitter account, "I didn't come up with the concept, but I'm very sorry and take full responsibility if it has offended anyone. I'd never condone Nazism in my art," also citing that her producer is Jewish.<ref name=nicktwitterresponse1>{{cite web|last1=Maraj|first1=Onika|title=NICKI MINAJ on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/532153631588376576|website=Twitter|accessdate=11 November 2014}}</ref> The artist behind the video, Jeff Osborne, refused to apologize for the video, confirming that the imagery used was indeed inspired by Nazism: "...if my work is misinterpreted because it’s not a sappy tearjerker, sorry I’m not sorry." Neither Minaj nor Osborne responded to criticism that the video was released on the anniversary of the [[Kristallnacht]].<ref name=pitchforkref>{{cite web|last1=Camp|first1=Zoe|title=Nicki Minaj Responds to Accusations of Nazi Imagery|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/57406-nicki-minaj-responds-to-accusations-of-nazi-imagery-in-only-lyric-video/|website=Pitchbook|accessdate=11 November 2014}}</ref> Minaj tweeted that Osborne was influenced by the ''[[Metalocalypse]]'' [[Dethklok]] music video for "The Gears" as well as ''[[Sin City]]'' when creating the music video. Brandon Small, creator of ''Metalocalypse'' responded to the comparison, stating that "They seem to be confused about art" before deconstruction the meaning behind both videos. He also added that he does not believe Minaj had poor intentions.<ref>[https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/532151721921748992 @NickiMinaj]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalinsider.net/video/metalocalypse-creator-brendon-small-comments-on-nicki-minaj-video |title=Metalocalypse creator Brendon Small on Nicki Minaj video: ‘They seem to be confused about art’ |publisher=Metal Insider |date=November 12, 2014 |accessdate=November 12, 2014 |author=Bram Teitelman }}</ref>

==Music video==
The accompanying music video for "Only", which was directed by [[Hannah Lux Davis]], premiered on December 12, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2014/12/12/video-nicki-minaj-f-drake-lil-wayne-chris-brown-only/|title=VIDEO: NICKI MINAJ F/ DRAKE, LIL WAYNE, & CHRIS BROWN – ‘ONLY’|date=December 12, 2014|accessdate=December 14, 2014|publisher=''Rap-Up''}}</ref> The video opens with an injured man lying on the floor in what appears to be a chamber. He is then taken to room were many other tortured men are tied up in a room. The video then cuts to Minaj who is wearing black-feathered lingerie. She raps wearing a sheer getup and sky-high platform heels. Minaj and Drake standing side by side while Nicki dons what looks like a black lace wedding veil. Minaj, Wayne, and Drake stand in a run-down dungeon as Minaj continues to rap.

==Recepção e crítica==

"Only" recebeu geralmente críticas positivas dos críticos. [[Carolyn Menyes]], de [[Music Times]], deu a canção um comentário positivo, dizendo que "com uma sensação legal de confiança e rimas que se orgulhar de sua própria potência sexual e rap, [[Nicki Minaj|Minaj]] está tomando as rédeas, levando para os versos de rap igualmente vulgares e explosivos de [[Drake (artista)|Drake]] e [[Lil Wayne|Wayne]]".<ref>{{citar web|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/13687/20141028/review-nicki-minaj-drake-lil-wayne-chris-brown-only-listen.htm|título=REVIEW: Nicki Minaj, Drake, Lil Wayne & Chris Brown Show Confident Presence on "Only" Ahead of 'The Pink Print' Release Date [LISTEN]|publicado=Music Times|acessodata=14 de novembro de 2014}}</ref> [[Miles Raymer]], da [[Entertainment Weekly]], elogiou o rap de [[Nicki Minaj|Minaj]] e chamou-lhe a melhor parte da música.<ref>{{citar web|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2014/10/28/nicki-minaj-drake-lil-wayne-chris-brown-only/|título=Nicki Minaj and some other, less important guys release 'Only'|publicado=Entrertainment Weekly|acessodata=14 de novembro de 2014}}</ref> Chris Coplan, de Consequence Of Sound, disse ainda que não fosse o esforço mais forte deles três, a canção era "uma grande demonstração de como suas personalidades distintas e separadas ainda pode jogar fora um ao outro muito bem".<ref>{{citar web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/10/nicki-minaj-teams-with-drake-and-lil-wayne-for-only-listen/|título=Nicki Minaj teams with Drake and Lil Wayne for “Only” — listen|publicado=Consequence Of Sound|acessodata=14 de novembro de 2014}}</ref> Drew Millard, de Noisey, elogiou o verso de Lil Wayne e disse: "Minaj continua a voltas de rap de todo o concurso e não há nenhuma indicação de que isso vai mudar qualquer momento em breve".<ref>{{citar web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/listen-to-nicki-minajs-only-featuring-drake-lil-wayne-and-chris-brown|título=Listen to Nicki Minaj's "Only," Featuring Drake, Lil Wayne, and Chris Brown|publicado=Noisey|acessodata=14 de novembro de 2014}}</ref>

Matthew Trammell, de THE FADER, deu a canção um comentário negativo, dizendo que [[Nicki Minaj|Minaj]] oferece "linhas sonolentas" e parece "um pouco desesperado".<ref>{{citar web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2014/10/28/nicki-minaj-releases-new-single-feat-drake-lil-wayne-and-chris-brown-only|título=Nicki Minaj Releases New Single Feat.

[[Nicki Minaj|Minaj]] foi acusada de apoiar o [[nazismo]] no vídeo de letras lançado em seu canal [[Vevo]] do [[YouTube]], onde, no seu refrão, a animação de Nicki tem um exército e uma bandeira que se parece com a mesma da [[Alemanha nazista]]. Nicki disse que nunca apoiou isso no seu vídeo e que se inspirou na série de caricaturas "[[Metalocalypse]]".<ref>{{citar web|url=http://g1.globo.com/musica/noticia/2014/11/nicki-minaj-se-desculpa-por-suposta-referencia-ao-nazismo-no-video-only.html|título=Nicki Minaj se desculpa por suposta referência ao nazismo no vídeo 'Only'|publicado=G1 (globo.com)|data=11 de novembro de 2014|acessodata=15 de novembro de 2014}}</ref>
