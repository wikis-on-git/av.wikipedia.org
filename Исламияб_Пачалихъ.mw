=== Criticism ===

There has been criticism of the predominantly white Oscar nominees and in other fields of nominees alike. For the third time since 1995, the 20 Academy Award acting nominations were only for white actors and actresses. The first was in [[70th Academy Awards|1998]] and second was in [[83rd Academy Awards|2011]].<ref name="THR">{{cite web | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-acting-nominees-all-white-764018 | title = Oscars: Acting Nominees All White | author = Tatiana Siegel | publisher = ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' | date = January 15, 2014 | accessdate = January 17, 2015}}</ref> David Sims of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' states "the surprising coolness towards Martin Luther King, Jr. biopic ''[[Selma (film)|Selma]]''—nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] but missing in the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Actor]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Original Screenplay]] categories—with the fact that all 20 acting nominees this year are white, the first time such a thing has happened since the Oscars honoring the films of 1995."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/01/the-oscars-havent-been-this-white-in-19-years/384550/|title=The Oscars Haven't Been This White in 19 Years|author=David Sims|date=January 15, 2015|work=The Atlantic}}</ref> David Carr of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that these nominations were in contrast to the [[86th Academy Awards|previous year's awards]], where ''[[12 Years a Slave (film)|12 Years a Slave]]'' won Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/19/business/media/why-the-oscars-omission-of-selma-matters.html|title=Why the Oscars’ Omission of ‘Selma’ Matters|author=David Carr|date=January 18, 2015|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

''[[The Guardian]]'' columnist [[Bidisha]] also notes the overwhelmingly white nominee list while also discussing the fact that "every nominated best director, screenwriter, screenplay adapter and original score composer is a white man,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/15/oscars-white-men-hollywood-women|title=The Oscars celebrates white men. What about the rest of us?|author=Bidisha|work=the Guardian}}</ref> additionally suggesting that there is an inherent lack of female representation in the Oscars this year beyond the [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] categories. ''Selma'' was directed by [[Ava DuVernay]], herself an African-American female. However, Best Director nominee [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]] is [[Latino]]. Additionally, all of the screenwriters for ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman]]'' are Latino; as well as the cinematographer, [[Emmanuel Lubezki]], and one of the nominees for Best Sound Editing for that same film.

In response to criticism about lack of diversity, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the president of the Film Academy, stated that “in the last two years, we’ve made greater strides than we ever have in the past toward becoming a more diverse and inclusive organization through admitting new members and more inclusive classes of members. And, personally, I would love to see and look forward to see a greater cultural diversity among all our nominees in all of our categories.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/3672675/academy-awards-president-diversity/|title=Film Academy President Wants Greater Cultural Diversity|author=Sam Frizell|work=TIME.com}}</ref> She refrained from commenting on whether the Academy was embarrassed about the lack of diversity, but stated that she was proud of all the nominees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/article/academy-awards-president-cheryl-boone-isaacs-oscars-diversity|title=Academy Awards President on Lack of Diversity in Oscars 2015 : People.com|work=PEOPLE.com}}

Kanye Omari West (/ˈkɑːnjeɪ/; born June 8, 1977) is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, director, entrepreneur, and fashion designer. West first gained prominence as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records; he achieved recognition for his work on rapper Jay-Z's The Blueprint (2001), as well as hit singles for musical artists including Alicia Keys, Ludacris, and Janet Jackson. His style of production originally used high-pitched vocal samples from soul songs incorporated with his own drums and instruments. He later broadened his influences to include 1970s R&B, baroque pop, trip hop, arena rock, house, folk, alternative, electronica, synthpop, industrial, and classical music.

West was raised in a middle-class household in Chicago, Illinois, and began rapping in the third grade, becoming involved in the city's hip hop scene. West attended art school for one semester before dropping out to pursue music entirely in the late 1990s. Although his real desire was to become a rapper, record executives did not take West seriously, viewing him as a producer first and foremost. After being signed to Roc-A-Fella in 2002, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to commercial and critical acclaim. The baroque-inspired Late Registration followed in 2005, and Graduation in 2007. West switched rapping for singing on his emotive 2008 effort 808's & Heartbreak, and embraced maximalism on 2010's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Following several collaborations, West released his sixth album, Yeezus, in 2013.

West is one of the world's best-selling artists of all time, having sold more than 21 million albums and 66 million digital downloads.[2] He has won a total of 21 Grammy Awards, making him one of the most awarded artists of all-time and the most Grammy-awarded artist of his age.[3] Time has named West one of the 100 most influential people in the world. He has also been included in a number of Forbes annual lists.[4] Three of his albums rank on Rolling Stone's 2012 "the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time" list; two of West's albums feature at #8 and #1 respectively in Pitchfork Media's The 100 Best Albums of 2010-2014.[5]

West's background and style, from his debut album, deviated from the then-dominant "gangsta" persona in hip hop, and he would later alter the genre stylistically as rappers adopted his alternative aesthetic. An outspoken and controversial celebrity, West has often been the source of incidents at award shows. His interest in fashion has also attracted media attention and differentiates West from other artists. West runs his own record label GOOD Music and has directed several short films.
