{{db|article was just a spam link. This wiki is unattended, and someone needs to stop the spammers or lock the wiki until someone who actually speaks the language arrives.}} I speak this language, can I arrive?

:Yes! Please do! It would be great if you could start contributing some articles in this language. After you've done a bit of that and it's clear that you know your way around you can request adminship by going and listing yourself on [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_permissions requests for permissions]. It would be really excellent if you could help get this edition of Wikipedia started.
